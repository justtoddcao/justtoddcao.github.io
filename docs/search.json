This setback became a turning point: I enrolled in the Master’s program at Open University Vietnam (ranked in the 801+ band for Business programs) to sharpen my skills. It was here that I discovered my passion not only for marketing and management, but also for teaching and research, which continue to shape my career today.\nAt Open University Vietnam, I was awarded a full scholarship after achieving the highest entrance examination score (18.88/20). I went on to earn the highest GPA in the program (8.44/10) and received the university’s top graduate award, often referred to as the valedictorian prize. In addition, I achieved the highest defense score (9.8/10), which was formally recognized with an award.

Through this program, I have developed strong skills in experimental research design, systematic literature reviews, and advanced tools including RStudio, Quarto, LaTeX, and GitHub.\nMy research centers on consumer well-being: how consumption can enhance happiness and quality of life. Recently, I have studied the role of Artificial Intelligence and deepfake influencers as emerging forces that reshape consumer experiences. Drawing on self-discrepancy theory and compensatory consumption, I explore how individuals respond when their identities feel threatened. Methodologically, I specialize in controlled experiments complemented by systematic literature reviews to ensure a strong theoretical foundation. Below is a network map visualizing my research interests:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs part of my PhD research, I create digital stimuli to test how consumers respond to emerging technologies in marketing.
