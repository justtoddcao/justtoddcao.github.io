As an early-stage researcher, I have begun building my publication record in Marketing and consumer behavior, with a focus on consumer well-being, self-discrepancy, and the role of user-generated content in shaping consumption. My list is shorter than that of more senior scholars, but it reflects a clear research direction and the foundation of a long-term academic career. I take pride in this beginning, and I am committed to expanding it as I pursue new projects and collaborations. Below is a list of my published and forthcoming work, along with articles currently under review.
