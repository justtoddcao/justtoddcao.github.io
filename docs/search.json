    "text": "First Project\nIn 2011, while studying at an English center, I could only afford the first month of tuition. Instead of giving up, I proposed an idea to the center manager: I would build a student speaker team to help others practice English before and after their classes. In return, I continued learning for free and received a small stipend of 600,000 VND (about 21 USD/month). What began with 3 members grew into a 20-member team by 2013, achieving a 4.5 out of 5 student satisfaction rating. This experience taught me how to market my skills and manage a project that created real value (Figure 1).\n\n\n\nFigure 1. My Yumetalk team — A snapshot from one of our events"

My role was to coordinate international volunteers who joined via Couchsurfing.com — from Indonesia, China, France, the Philippines, and beyond (Figure 2). In exchange for accommodation, they worked each night as communicators with Vietnamese customers. Leading this diverse group taught me how to manage across cultures, build trust, and create teamwork among people from very different backgrounds.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.

My role focused on offline activities such as creating agendas for her fan meetings and makeup classes. Her fame was already well established by the time I joined her team, and while my contribution was modest, I became a small but important link that helped her events run smoothly.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.

One of my first was for Cali elementary school, where I hosted an outdoor event with nearly 80 guests (Figure 4). I coordinated outsourced partners including a music band and an MC, and worked with the police to secure the event permit. The event was a success, and the school owner, pleased with the outcome, entrusted me with two more events at her other campuses in Go Vap and Thu Duc Districts.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.

Inspired by this, I created a local version of the “The Amazing Race” and sold tickets for 600,000 VND (about 29 USD) to 24 participants (Figure 5). They were divided into 4 teams and challenged to solve quizzes that led them to 5 different locations across Ho Chi Minh City. Along the way, they had to team up with foreigners to complete the challenges. This campaign not only gave participants a fun and meaningful experience but also became a stepping stone that later helped me enter larger companies.\n\n\n\nFigure 5. Snapshots of The Amazing Race"
