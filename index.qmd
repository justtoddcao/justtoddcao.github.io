I’m Todd Cao, a Vietnamese PhD Candidate in Management at the University of Southern Queensland, Australia and Open University Vietnam, preparing to complete my doctorate and begin the next chapter as a lecturer.

I am curious about how consumption can make consumers happy; in other words, consumer well-being. I am now expanding into the study of Deepfake influencers, who I believe can also bring joy to people's lives. Alongside my research, I bring more than ten years of teaching experience across companies and universities, supported by a career that spans industries from education to the non-profit sectors.

Outside academia, I am an amateur guitarist with a love for dogs. It is  my time to step up as a man again who provides for those I love, including my family and two homeless children, Atri and Axet.To make this website more personal, I’ve prepared a quick video introduction.
