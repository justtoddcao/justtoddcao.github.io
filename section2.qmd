## Overview
From 2011 to 2016, I dedicated my heart to my freelance projects in marketing and management. Since 2016, my career has evolved from marketing and brand management in an international school to lecturing at several companies and universities between 2020 and 2024, where I developed my passion for teaching and student engagement [(Table 1)](#tb1).
