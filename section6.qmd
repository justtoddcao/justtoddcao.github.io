I know my resume may look different from others. Many applicants bring long publication lists or big-company experience. What I bring is the perspective of someone who has built knowledge step by step: from working with small businesses, to creating real projects, to teaching with care. I understand the values that matter to students, and I bring the empathy, practical knowledge, and commitment that help them succeed inside and outside the classroom.

Below is my resume, which provides a full overview of my academic background, teaching experience, publications, and professional journey. If you are still here, thank you for taking the time to understand who I am and what I can offer.
